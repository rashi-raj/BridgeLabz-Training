**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the concept of constructors in Java, their rules, and how they are used to initialize objects
- Practiced constructor overloading using default, parameterized, and copy constructors with a real-world Coffee Shop Order example
- Understood and implemented access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `default`, `private`) and their scope of accessibility
- Differentiated between instance and class (static) variables and methods using practical examples
- Completed all assigned programs and verified outputs successfully

### 📅 Day 3 – Java Inbuilt Keywords (`this`, `static`, `final`, `instanceof`)
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

- Learned and understood the purpose and usage of Java inbuilt keywords: this, static, final, and instanceof
- Used the this keyword to resolve ambiguity between instance variables and constructor parameters and to support constructor chaining
- Implemented static variables and methods for shared data, utility functions, and memory-efficient class-level behavior
- Applied the final keyword to create constants, prevent reassignment, restrict method overriding, and stop class inheritance
- Used the instanceof operator for safe type-checking before casting objects in polymorphic scenarios
- Developed and verified real-world programs including Bank Account System, Library Management System, Employee Management System, and Shopping Cart System

### 📅 Day 4 – Classes, Objects & Object-Oriented Design Basics
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the difference between Classes and Objects including definition, purpose, memory allocation, syntax, and real-world relevance
- Understood class as a blueprint and object as an instance, with heap memory allocation for objects and shared structure via classes
- Implemented a Bank Account System to demonstrate object creation, method invocation, encapsulation, and unique object states
- Designed a School Management System using multiple interacting classes (Student, Teacher, Course, School)
- Explored object relationships such as `association` and `aggregation`, and how objects communicate using method calls
- Studied UML basics, including Class Diagrams (static structure) and Sequence Diagrams (dynamic interaction flow) for system design

### 📅 Day 5 – Java Inheritance & Polymorphism
**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the concept of Inheritance in Java as a core OOP principle for reusing and extending existing class behavior
- Understood superclass and subclass relationships, including how child classes inherit fields and methods from parent classes
- Implemented different types of inheritance: `Single`, `Multilevel`, `Hybrid` and `Hierarchical` using real-world examples
- Practiced method overriding to achieve runtime polymorphism and modify parent class behavior in child classes
- Studied constructor chaining using `super()` and learned why constructors are not inherited in Java
- Explored access modifiers (public, protected, default, private) and their role in inheritance and data visibility

### 📅 Day 6 – Encapsulation, Polymorphism & OOP Scenario-Based Design
**(Date: 01-Jan-2026)**

- Learned Encapsulation to achieve data hiding and integrity using private fields with public getters/setters, implemented through a Bank Account System with proper validation
- Studied Polymorphism, including compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) to enable flexible and reusable code
- Practiced polymorphism using inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes, along with safe downcasting using instanceof
- Understood Abstract Classes vs Interfaces, their differences, use cases, and best practices for building loosely coupled and scalable systems
- Learned a structured approach to solve OOP scenario-based problems, including identifying entities, responsibilities, relationships, and behaviors
- Applied OOP design planning by defining classes, attributes, methods, constructors, access modifiers, and choosing appropriate data structures (arrays, lists, maps) based on problem requirements Learned Abstract Classes vs Interfaces, their features, differences, use cases, and best practices for designing scalable and loosely coupled systems
