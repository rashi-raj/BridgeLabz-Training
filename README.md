### 📅 Day 1 – Java Generics (Fundamentals & Scenarios)
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

- Learned Generics basics: type safety, reusability, compile-time checks, and removal of type casting.
- Practiced generic classes, methods, bounded types, and wildcards.
- Implemented real-world scenarios:
   - `Smart Warehouse` – Generic storage with bounded types.
   - `Online Marketplace` – Generic products and discount methods.
   - `University Course System` – Managed multiple course types using wildcards.
   - `Meal Plan Generator` – Validated meal categories with bounded generics.
   - `AI Resume Screening` – Processed resumes for multiple job roles safely.
