### 📅 Day 1 – Explored DSA - Linked List 
**(Date: 02-Jan-2026)**

- Learned Linked List fundamentals including node structure, dynamic memory usage, and traversal
- Implemented Linked List types: `Singly Linked List`, `Doubly Linked List`, and `Circular Linked List`
- Created custom Node structures for each linked list type
- Performed insertion operations (beginning, end, specific position)
- Implemented deletion operations by value and by position
- Solved real world problems using linked list

### 📅 Day 2 – Explored Stack, Queue and HashMaps
**(Date: 03-Jan-2026)**

- Learned Stack data structure and implemented operations like push, pop, peek using LIFO principle
- Practiced Queue concepts with enqueue, dequeue, and front operations following FIFO order
- Explored real-world use cases of Stack (undo/redo, expression evaluation) and Queue (task scheduling, buffering)
- Studied HashMap for key–value storage, fast lookups, insertions, and deletions
- Understood Hash Functions, hashing mechanism, and collision handling concepts
- Solved basic problems using HashMap such as frequency counting and lookup-based logic

### 📅 Day 3 – Practiced Sorting Algorithms
**(Date: 05-Jan-2026)**

- Learned Sorting Algorithms to arrange data efficiently in ascending order
- Implemented `Bubble Sort` using repeated adjacent comparisons and swaps
- Practiced `Selection Sort` by selecting the minimum element for correct placement
- Studied `Insertion Sort` by inserting elements into their correct position in a sorted part
- Implemented `Merge Sort` using divide-and-conquer technique
- Practiced `Quick Sort` using pivot-based partitioning and recursion
- Learned `Heap Sort` using heap data structure for efficient sorting
- Implemented `Counting Sort` as a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm
