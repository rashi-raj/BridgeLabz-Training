### 📅 Day 1 – Software Design Principles & GoF Design Patterns
**(Date: 31-Jan-2026)**

 - This repository reflects my learning and practice of core software design principles and `GoF design patterns`, essential for building clean, maintainable, and scalable applications.
 - I studied and applied `SOLID principles` (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) along with key design guidelines such as `DRY`, `KISS`, and `YAGNI` to improve code quality and design decisions.
 - The repository also covers GoF Design Patterns, their categories (`Creational`, `Structural`, `Behavioural`), and commonly used patterns like `Singleton`, `Factory`, `Observer`, and `Builder`.

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Multithreading
**(Date: 02-Feb-2026)**

 - Practice Java Multithreading concepts and how to build concurrent and high-performance applications.
 - I covered core topics such as `thread creation`, `lifecycle`, `synchronisation`, `locks`, `inter-thread communication`, `Executor framework`, `Callable`, and `ThreadLocal`.
 - The focus was on understanding real-world scenarios, `thread safety`, `race conditions`, and `performance considerations`.
 - Practical examples and scenarios were practised to strengthen the concept.
