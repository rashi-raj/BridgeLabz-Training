### 📅 Day 1 – Software Design Principles & GoF Design Patterns
**(Date: 31-Jan-2026)**

 - This repository reflects my learning and practice of core software design principles and `GoF design patterns`, essential for building clean, maintainable, and scalable applications.
 - I studied and applied `SOLID principles` (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) along with key design guidelines such as `DRY`, `KISS`, and `YAGNI` to improve code quality and design decisions.
 - The repository also covers GoF Design Patterns, their categories (`Creational`, `Structural`, `Behavioural`), and commonly used patterns like `Singleton`, `Factory`, `Observer`, and `Builder`.
