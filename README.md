### 📅 Day 1 –  Functional Interface and Lambda expressions
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**

- Worked with Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces to write concise and modern Java code:
- Understood Functional Interface (interface with only one abstract method)
- Used built-in functional interfaces:
  - Predicate – condition checking
  - Consumer – performs action without return
  - Function – input → output mapping
  - Supplier – provides values without input
- Applied lambdas with Collections for filtering, sorting, and processing data
- Reduced boilerplate code and improved readability
- Practiced real-world scenarios using Java 8+ functional programming
- Focused on clean, expressive, and efficient Java coding using lambdas and functional interfaces.

### 📅 Day 2 –  Stream API and Collectors
**(Date: 28-Jan-2026)**

- Explored Java Stream API and Collectors for powerful data processing:
- Created streams from Collections
- Used intermediate operations: filter, map, flatMap, sorted
- Applied terminal operations: forEach, collect, count, reduce
- Worked with Collectors:
  - toList, toSet, toMap
  - groupingBy, partitioningBy
  - counting, averaging, summarizing
- Solved real-world scenarios like employee data analysis and student result processing
- Understood benefits of functional-style, readable, and efficient data handling
- Focused on transforming, filtering, and aggregating data using Streams + Collectors for clean Java code.
