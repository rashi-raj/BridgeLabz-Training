### 📅 Day 1 – Java Generics (Fundamentals & Scenarios)
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

- Learned Generics basics: type safety, reusability, compile-time checks, and removal of type casting.
- Practiced generic classes, methods, bounded types, and wildcards.
- Implemented real-world scenarios:
   - `Smart Warehouse` – Generic storage with bounded types.
   - `Online Marketplace` – Generic products and discount methods.
   - `University Course System` – Managed multiple course types using wildcards.
   - `Meal Plan Generator` – Validated meal categories with bounded generics.
   - `AI Resume Screening` – Processed resumes for multiple job roles safely.

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

- Explored the `Java Collections Framework` to understand its purpose, structure, and overall hierarchy.
- Worked with core interfaces such as `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`, and `Map` and their common implementations.
- Compared different collection implementations based on `performance`, `ordering`, `duplication`, and `thread-safety`.
- Applied `real-world use cases and best practices` to select the most efficient collection for specific problem scenarios.

### 📅 Day 3 – Java Streams 
**(Date: 19-Jan-2026)**

- Implemented `Java I/O Streams` to handle file-based and in-memory data operations efficiently.
- Worked with `File Streams`, `Object Streams`, `ByteArray Streams`, `Buffered Streams`, and `Reader/Writer classes`.
- Understood the differences between `byte` and `character streams` for proper data handling.
- Applied key considerations and best practices for performance, buffering, and resource management.

### 📅 Day 4 – Java Exception Handling
**(Date: 20-Jan-2026)**

- Implemented comprehensive `Java Exception Handling` concepts, including `checked`, `unchecked`, and `custom exceptions`.
- Used `try-catch`, `try-catch-finally`, and `try-with-resources` for safe execution and resource management.
- Applied `throw` and `throws` for exception propagation and control flow.
- Created custom exceptions by `extending Exception` and defining constructors for meaningful `error handling`.
