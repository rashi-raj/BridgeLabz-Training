### 📅 Day 1 – Java OOPS Basics
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its advantages over Procedural Programming
- Understood Class and Object concepts, object creation, and memory allocation
- Practiced using constructors, attributes, and methods with real-world examples (Student, Car, TravelDetails)
- Compared Procedural Programming vs OOP in terms of scalability, reusability, and data security
- Followed best practices for naming conventions and modular program structure

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Constructors & Access Modifiers
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the concept of constructors in Java, their rules, and how they are used to initialize objects
- Practiced constructor overloading using default, parameterized, and copy constructors with a real-world Coffee Shop Order example
- Understood and implemented access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `default`, `private`) and their scope of accessibility
- Differentiated between instance and class (static) variables and methods using practical examples
- Completed all assigned programs and verified outputs successfully

### 📅 Day 3 – Java Inbuilt Keywords (`this`, `static`, `final`, `instanceof`)
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

- Learned and understood the purpose and usage of Java inbuilt keywords: this, static, final, and instanceof
- Used the this keyword to resolve ambiguity between instance variables and constructor parameters and to support constructor chaining
- Implemented static variables and methods for shared data, utility functions, and memory-efficient class-level behavior
- Applied the final keyword to create constants, prevent reassignment, restrict method overriding, and stop class inheritance
- Used the instanceof operator for safe type-checking before casting objects in polymorphic scenarios
- Developed and verified real-world programs including Bank Account System, Library Management System, Employee Management System, and Shopping Cart System

### 📅 Day 4 – Classes, Objects & Object-Oriented Design Basics
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the difference between Classes and Objects including definition, purpose, memory allocation, syntax, and real-world relevance
- Understood class as a blueprint and object as an instance, with heap memory allocation for objects and shared structure via classes
- Implemented a Bank Account System to demonstrate object creation, method invocation, encapsulation, and unique object states
- Designed a School Management System using multiple interacting classes (Student, Teacher, Course, School)
- Explored object relationships such as `association` and `aggregation`, and how objects communicate using method calls
- Studied UML basics, including Class Diagrams (static structure) and Sequence Diagrams (dynamic interaction flow) for system design
