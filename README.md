### 📅 Day 1 –  Functional Interface and Lambda expressions
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**

- Worked with Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces to write concise and modern Java code:
- Understood Functional Interface (interface with only one abstract method)
- Used built-in functional interfaces:
  - Predicate – condition checking
  - Consumer – performs action without return
  - Function – input → output mapping
  - Supplier – provides values without input
- Applied lambdas with Collections for filtering, sorting, and processing data
- Reduced boilerplate code and improved readability
- Practiced real-world scenarios using Java 8+ functional programming
- Focused on clean, expressive, and efficient Java coding using lambdas and functional interfaces.
